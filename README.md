# Diagram Description: Multi-Layered Architecture

This diagram illustrates a structured approach to application development, divided into three distinct layers: **Presentation Layer**, **Domain (Business) Layer**, and **Data Layer**. Each layer focuses on a specific set of responsibilities to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## 1. **Presentation Layer**
- **Purpose**: Handles user-facing components and visual interactions.
- **Structure**:
  - The applicationâ€™s entry point initializes necessary configurations and dependencies.
  - The layer is composed of modular sections or pages, each dedicated to a specific feature or functionality.

---

## 2. **Domain aka Business Layer**
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the core business logic and operations.
- **Role**:
  - Prepares data and functionality for the Presentation Layer by abstracting complex processes.
  - Provides reusable mechanisms for domain-specific tasks and workflows.

---

## 3. **Data Layer**
- **Purpose**: Facilitates communication with external data sources, ensuring data is processed and errors are managed effectively.
- **Structure**:
  - Composed of API-specific components responsible for interacting with external services.
  - Separates low-level operations from higher-level abstractions to provide clean and consistent data.

---

## Network Requests
- The Data Layer performs network requests to external services.
- These requests are processed to deliver usable data to the upper layers of the architecture.

---

### Summary
This multi-layered design promotes:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer focuses on a distinct responsibility.
2. **Reusability**: Components and logic are modular and easily reusable.
3. **Scalability**: New features or external integrations can be added with minimal disruption.
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between layers simplify updates and debugging.
